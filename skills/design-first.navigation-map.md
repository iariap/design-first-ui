# Skill: design-first.navigation-map

## Goal

Define the global navigation flow before screen design begins.

## Inputs

- Product flows and user journeys

## Output

Produce `02a_navigation_map.md` with:

- Screen list and roles
- Navigation actions
- Conditional branches
- Entry/exit points
- Mermaid flowchart in a fenced code block inside the same file (do not create a separate .mmd or Mermaid file).

## Constraints

- Keep it global and system-level.
- No per-screen layout details.
- Do not create `02a_navigation_map.mmd` or any separate file for the diagram; the diagram belongs only in `02a_navigation_map.md`.
- If multiple self-loop edges exist, add a comment node to prevent label overlap.
