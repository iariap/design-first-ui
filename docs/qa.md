# Design-First UI QA Checklist

## Global

- Canvas system is defined and current
- Token set is defined and current
- Global artifacts are referenced, not duplicated

## Per-screen

- Structure is clear and complete
- Wireframe is layout-only
- Canvas applied without layout drift
- UI mock uses tokens only
- No upstream fixes done in final mock
- Final mock is implementable without interpretation
