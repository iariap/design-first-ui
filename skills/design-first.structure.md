# Skill: design-first.structure

## Goal

Define the structure of a screen before any visual decisions are made.

## Inputs

- Global system constraints from `docs/process.md` and `docs/canvas.md`

## Output

Produce `03_structure.md` with:

- Screen purpose
- User goal
- Information hierarchy
- Primary interactions
- Data or content blocks
- System constraints that impact layout

## Constraints

- Do not reference colors, typography, or visual styling.
- Do not define tokens.
- Keep structure explicit and implementable.
