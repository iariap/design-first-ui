# Design-First UI QA Checklist

## Global

- 01_canvas_system.md exists and is current
- 02_ui_tokens.md exists and is current
- Global artifacts are referenced, not duplicated

## Per-screen

- Structure is clear and complete
- Wireframe is layout-only
- Canvas applied without layout drift
- UI mock uses tokens only
- No upstream fixes done in final mock
- Final mock is implementable without interpretation
